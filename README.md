# RaspberryPi

This is a GitHub repository for use during the Raspberry Pi Book Club at Harris. Our first meeting was Monday, August 22, 2016. The first homework assignment was to come back in 2 weeks with 20 ideas per person on projects for the group to complete.

Projects can be small, that each person does by themselves, or we can all collaborate on a larger project.
